  \item Lack of concurrency control can lead to reciprocally inconsistent edges
  \item Semantic corruption spreads quickly in a graph database
  \item \tDelta protocol prevents reciprocal inconsistency given the bound $\Delta$ in not violated
  \item \tDelta protocol significantly reduces the time until operational corruption at the cost of some aborts
