  \frametitle{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Lack of concurrency control in a distributed graph database can lead to reciprocally inconsistent distributed edges
    \item Resulting in the spread of semantic corruption
  \item \tDelta protocol prevents reciprocal inconsistency given $\Delta$ is not exceeded
  \item \tDelta protocol significantly reduces the spread of semantic corruption at the cost of a very small fraction of aborts
  \end{itemize}
